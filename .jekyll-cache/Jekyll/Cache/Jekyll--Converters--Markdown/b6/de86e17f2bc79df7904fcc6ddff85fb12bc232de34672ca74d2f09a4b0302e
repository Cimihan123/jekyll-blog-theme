<!-- excerpt-start -->
<p>You may be familiar with the concept of pivoting. Pivoting is the way to move from one comporised system<!-- excerpt-end --> to another system.
<br /></p>

<p>Suppose,
<br />
“A”  has access “B”.<br />
“B” has access “C”.<br />
“A” does not have access “C”.<br /></p>

<p>So how can we access “C” directly from “A”? Well, that’s direcly not possbile so we use the concept of pivoting. “A” can use “B” as the foothold to get access to “C”.
“A” first compromise the system “B” then can use this machine as the lauch point to attack the “C”.</p>

<h2 id="lab-creation-overview">Lab Creation Overview</h2>

<p>To have some practises on pivoting I created a lab in docker.</p>

<p>Figure below gives the overview of the network setup of the docker compose files.
Victim1 and Victim2 are our targets.They are on subnet <em>172.16.101.0/24</em>. Attacker is on different subnet <em>172.16.100.0/24</em>.</p>

<p>Our helper machine  ( gateway machine ) will sit on both subnetworks.</p>

<h3 id="brief-overview-of-docker-compose-files">Brief Overview of Docker Compose Files</h3>

<p>You can get the docker compose files from my github repo.</p>

<p>Github Link: <a href="https://github.com/Cimihan123/Pivoting">Repository</a></p>

<p>For this lab two networks  are created:-</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>attacker</strong> -&gt; having subnet <em>172.16.100.0/24</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>victim</strong> -&gt; having subnet <em>172.16.101.0/24</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>By default docker use bridge driver. We are sticking with it although we can specify different network drivers.</p>

<p align="center">Fig: docker-compose-subnet.yml</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Notice <em>helper</em> container is built locally. This will make easy as the base image will be customized rather than pulling everytime.</p>

<p>This container is part of the both networks: <em>attacker</em> and <em>victim</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog4-pivoting/3-helper.png" alt=" helper image &gt;&lt;" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig: docker-compose.yml</p>

<p>A baseimage is being pulled.I have enabled ssh root login I don’t recommend doing this in your production environment or anywhere without proper security guidelines.XD</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog4-pivoting/4-helper-image.png" alt=" helper image &gt;&lt;" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig: helper.Dockerfile</p>

<p><em>attacker</em> is the part of <em>attacker</em> subnet having an ip of <em>172.16.100.10</em></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog4-pivoting/5-attacker.png" alt=" attacker image &gt;&lt;" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig: docker-compose.yml</p>

<p><em>attacker</em> container also uses the <em>phusion/baseimage</em>. Additionally some other tools ( ping, nmap etc ) will be installed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog4-pivoting/5-attacker-image.png" alt=" attacker image &gt;&lt;" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig: attacker.Dockerfile</p>

<p><em>victim</em> container is also built locally. It does have network ip <em>172.16.101.10</em>. This is the part of subnet <em>172.16.101.0/24</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog4-pivoting/6-victim1.png" alt=" victim1 image &gt;&lt;" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig: docker-compose.yml</p>

<p>I have installed <em>sar2html</em> Github Link: <a href="https://github.com/cemtan/sar2html/">Repository</a>.</p>

<p>It is the plotting tool for system statistics. There is an issue in this tool. We will discuss about this on different section. For now just assume there is a vulnerability in this tool.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog4-pivoting/6-victim1-image.png" alt=" victim1 image &gt;&lt;" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig: victim1.Dockerfile</p>

<p>For <em>victim2</em> there is no need to manipluate the image locally. There is already a vulnerable wordpress in docker hub. We just pull it from there. Below image show the structure to configure the wordpress as we also need a database server. They are in same subnetwork so they can communicate with each other.</p>

<h3 id="running-and-checking">Running and Checking</h3>

<p>As far now we have brief overview of our lab enviroment. Now we run the docker compose files and check them.</p>

<p>We first build them. It may take some time for pulling, download and installing. Then we create and run the created containers.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker-compose <span class="nt">-f</span> docker-compose-subnet.yml <span class="nt">-f</span> docker-compose.yml build
docker-compose <span class="nt">-f</span> docker-compose-subnet.yml <span class="nt">-f</span> docker-compose.yml up <span class="nt">--remove-orphans</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p> </p>

<p>There are total of 5 containers running.Once <em>Attacker</em>, <em>helper</em>, <em>victim1</em> and <em>victim2</em> are running  we check the connection between them.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog4-pivoting/8-dockercompose.png" alt=" dockercomposeup image &gt;&lt;" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig: docker compose build &amp; up</p>

<p><em>attacker</em> container can reach the <em>helper</em> network.You see the successful ping reply back from the <em>helper</em>.</p>

<p>I guess you can figure it out from the below picture.</p>

<h2 id="attacking-and-pivoting">Attacking and Pivoting</h2>

<p>Let’s first prefer discovering the ports in <em>helper</em> host.So our target is first to get access into the <em>helper</em> host.</p>
